# A105-Nonlinear_Waves
Project code for lecture A105.

In this project we look at the drop formation and beads on a string for a fluid thread.
We also solve Burgers' equation under a constant forcing (gravity) and provide a mapping from an arbitrary purely-time forcing to the homogeneous Burgers' equation.

For more details, check the project report `docs/A105_Project.pdf`.
